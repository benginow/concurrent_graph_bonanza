Test case format

Prepend with u/d
u = undirected
d = directed

Create a node with id 1 (graphs will keep track of their own
internal ids, no need to worry about numbering)
a 1

Connect nodes 1 and 2 with an edge of weight 3
a 1 2 3

Change weight of edge between 1 and 2 to 4
c 1 2 4

Remove edge between nodes 1 and 2
a 1 2

Remove node 2, which will also remove all edges associated with node 2
r 2
